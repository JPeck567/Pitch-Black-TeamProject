# Pitch-Black-TeamProject
Race though a dark dungeon as an explorer. Dubbed as the "Pitch Black" by archaic explorers of the past, escape the non-stop approach of poisonous fog among other explorers in a bid for freedom! After fighting you way though the dark depths, you and your team of explorers finally eye-out treasures beyond your wildest dreams! Basking in your newfound riches, you unknowingly trigger a curse. One which has you fighting against your spelunkers in fear of your lives!
